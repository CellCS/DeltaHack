Title: A mobile system monitoring and predict Cardiac Arrest by using biosensors.

Scope: High risk of Cardiac Arrest users/or some heart disease patients (atrial fibrillation/arrhythmia)

Objectives: 
1 By using wearable sensors to monitor heart rate and other parameters
2 Using K-Mean unsupervised method to clustering personazied heart rate range
3 Using SVM/Ramdon Forest Tress to classify the real-time data from biosensor
4 Once high risk of cardia arrest, the app will send alarm to users, and send sms/email to emergency contact with user's location
  App search the nearst Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) device.
5 Contack emergency department to make further decision
